This means you'll stay comfortable even when the thermostat adjusts during the event. If you prefer not to participate you can manually adjust your settings at any time during the event.\nHow often do Peak Time Events occur?, Typically there are about 8 to 9 events each summer and 5 to 6 in the winter. We avoid scheduling these on holidays to ensure your comfort during those special times. Summer events usually occur between 3 PM and 8 PM while in winter they\u2019re likely to be between 6 AM and 10 AM or 3 PM and 8 PM.\nWhat happens during a Peak Time Event in the Smart Thermostat Program?, During Peak Time Events which occur on days with high energy demand your smart thermostat will automatically adjust by 1 to 3 degrees from your normal settings to help manage the energy load. These adjustments are pre-programmed to ensure your comfort and are usually brief lasting between 1 to 4 hours. You don\u2019t need to do anything; your thermostat handles everything and it'll return to your regular settings once the event ends.\nWhat is the Smart Thermostat Program?, The Smart Thermostat Program is a fantastic way to manage your energy use efficiently. By enrolling your thermostat will automatically shift some of your energy use away from peak times when energy demand is high known as Peak Time Events. These events occur typically 8 to 9 times each summer and 5 to 6 times each winter lasting between 1 to 4 hours. During these events your thermostat automatically adjusts by a few degrees. This subtle adjustment helps you save on your energy bills supports more sustainable energy use and keeps the energy grid reliable. You\u2019ll earn up to $25 for signing up plus an additional $25 on your PGE bill each summer and winter season you participate.

Additionally for each summer and winter season that you participate in at least half of the Peak Time Event hours you earn another $25. This is a great way to reduce your energy bill while contributing to a cleaner energy future.\nWhat is Time of Use?, Time of Use is a variable rate structure charges for energy depending on the time of day and the season the energy is used\nHow do I enroll in Time of Use?, The residential enrollment is closed to new participants as of January 1 2024 but small business customers can still enroll if they meet the usage criteria. \nWho can enroll in Time of Use?, Residential and eligible small business customers\nWhat is the benefit of using Time of Use?, Small businesses that primarily use electricity during off-peak hours can benefit from lower rates especially if they operate at night or on weekends charge electric vehicles overnight or have flexible usage patterns.\nWhat happened to the residential participants after December 31 2024?, This portfolio option will expire for all residential participants after December 31 2024 at which time any remaining participants will be placed on the basic service rate.\nHow does Time of Use pricing work for electric usage?, The rate is lower on nights and weekends and higher at high-demand times such as weekday mornings and evenings.\nWhat are Peak Time Rebates?, When energy demand and prices are high you'll have the option to reduce your energy use during the Peak Time Event which is typically 3 to 4 hours. When you reduce your energy use you can earn a rebate on your next bill. Plus shifting your energy away from peak times makes a difference. You\u2019re supporting the use of more sustainable energy resources and helping to keep energy more reliable. It\u2019s a win-win-WIN!\nWhen are Peak Time Events called?, Peak Time Events can be called in the morning between 7 am 11 a.m. and in the late afternoon between 3 and 8 p.m. In the winter you might notice more morning events. During the summer season Peak Time Events will most commonly occur in the late afternoon. The events can be two to five hours in length but most often last for three hours. You'll receive a notification the day before the event with the specific times it will occur.\nDo I need to provide PGE with an email or mobile to partipate in Peak Time Rebates?, Yes. To be enrolled in Peak Time Rebates you need to provide PGE with either an email address and/or a mobile phone number to receive Peak Time Event notifications. You can choose to receive notifications by email text or both - it's up to you. You must maintain at least one notification channel in order to remain enrolled. For example if you provide only a mobile phone number and reply STOP to text notifications you'll be unenrolled from Peak Time Rebates. You can update your notification preferences on the Peak Time Rebates webpage or call PGE Customer Service at 800-542-8818.\nHow are Peak Time Rebates calculated?, Your energy use baseline is calculated from your average use over the past 10 similar days during the same hours as the Peak Time Event. You earn $1 per kilowatt hour (kWh) when you reduce below your baseline during a Peak Time Event. \n\nThe calculation in four steps:\n\nStep 1: PGE looks at the 10 most recent days that are similar in type (weekday or weekend). . Holidays or any previous Peak Time Event days are not considered similar days and are not included in establishing the 10-day baseline period.\n\nStep 2: Using the selected 10 days for your baseline period PGE identifies your home\u2019s average use during the same hours as the Peak Time Event.So if the upcoming Peak Time Event is from 4:00 \u2013 7:00 p.m. PGE will determine your home\u2019s average use during the hours of 4:00 -7:00 p.m.\n\nStep 3: Because the weather on the Peak Time Event day may not be exactly the same as the 10 days selected for the baseline period PGE applies an adjustment for the difference in temperature for some customers if your historical usage indicates a significant difference in electrical use when the temperature changes.", "start_char_idx": 62408, "end_char_idx": 67161, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ff35ae9-67c9-43e3-aeda-8baa099b622c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ff35ae9-67c9-43e3-aeda-8baa099b622c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\adria\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Github repos\\BANA577-Capstone\\combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_name": "combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_type": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "file_size": 172049, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "file_path", "file_name"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "file_path", "file_name"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "160a4f13-7b42-4386-a6e5-e18da52055ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\adria\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Github repos\\BANA577-Capstone\\combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_name": "combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_type": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "file_size": 172049, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "391221ff4e9dec9643264f2a4730f4402b2f352e721e7cddefda949c3b7d5fa6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4973f08-6ba0-4046-8cde-27e0ac0d60e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\adria\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Github repos\\BANA577-Capstone\\combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_name": "combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_type": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "file_size": 172049, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "1f9d4bb06e734fad616d54813d2978201dcf56f3cb2e3aeae7eaad4231ec4114", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05101eef-1fd0-4bc0-9383-13afcf4d7c66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "64c47114420800f18ee69ab08183931d068a3a208604b34dc2183f191ac1d7cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The calculation in four steps:\n\nStep 1: PGE looks at the 10 most recent days that are similar in type (weekday or weekend). .

For example you may have higher use in summer because of air conditioning or in the winter due to electric heating. This will determine your home\u2019s energy usage baseline or \u201cTypical Use.\u201d\n\nStep 4: We subtract the total kilowatt hours you use during the Peak Time Event or \u201cActual Event Use\u201d from your \u201cTypical Use\u201d as shown in the calculation below. If your energy use during the event is less than your Typical Use you earn a rebate at a rate of $1.00 per kilowatt hour.\n\n\nCustomer rebate baseline and rebate calculation:\n\n(Typical Use + Weather Adjustment) \u2013 Actual Event Use = kWh Savings\n\nkWh Savings x $1.00 = Rebate\n\nExample with Peak Time Event data and rebate:\n\n(3.67 kWh + 1.1 kWh) \u2013 2.21 kWh = 2.56 kWh\n\n2.56 kWh x $1.00/kWh = $2.56 (Rebate amount that would appear on your bill)\nHow will I know if I earned a rebate after a Peak Time Event?, When you enroll in the program you have the choice to be notified by email and/or text. After each Peak Time Event you will receive a message one to three days later to let you know if you earned a rebate and for how much. If you earned a rebate this amount will appear as a credit on your next bill.\nWhat if I don't participate in a Peak Time Event?, Your participation is completely voluntary. Once you\u2019re enrolled you\u2019re eligible for a bill credit during any event where you successfully reduce your energy use. If you aren\u2019t able to save energy during an event you\u2019ll still be enrolled and have other opportunities to participate in the future. Your health and safety should always come first so please consider any health impacts when reducing your energy use.\nI did my best to shift my energy use but didn't receive a rebate. How come?, If you\u2019re a customer who doesn\u2019t use much electricity on a daily basis it may be more difficult to reduce your use during Peak Time Events. Turning off lights or waiting to charge your phone won\u2019t make much of an impact during a Peak Time Event. You can make the biggest impact by reducing the use of major appliances using less hot water and turning your thermostat down a few degrees if you have electric heat or air conditioning.\nWhere will Peak Time Rebates credits appear on my bill and how often?, Peak Time Rebates will appear in the \u201cAdditional Charges/Credits\u201d area of your bill as \u201cpeak time credits.\u201d Rebates should appear on the next bill you receive after the Peak Time Event.\nCan I be enrolled in Peak Time Rebates as well as the PGE Smart Thermostat program?, Unfortunately no \u2014 you can't be in both programs at once. However if you have a smart thermostat you may want to consider joining the PGE Smart Thermostat program where you can earn $25 per season for participating.

Earn rebates\nIf you reduce your energy use during the Peak Time Event you can earn a rebate on your next bill.\nWhat is the Smart Battery pilot?, PGE launched its five-year Smart Battery pilot in 2020. Through this program PGE partners with residential customers with home battery storage systems. The program seeks to install and connect residential energy storage batteries that will contribute up to 9.5 megawatt hours of energy to our grid. Once installed these battery storage systems will help create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that is made up of residential battery systems that can be operated individually or combined to serve the grid adding flexibility that supports our transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition these home battery storage systems provide customers with a backup energy resource they can rely on in the event of a power outage.\nWhy is PGE doing this?, As we build a cleaner energy future and add more renewable power like wind and solar to our mix we\u2019re developing energy storage so we can make the best use of these more intermittent resources. This is one of five projects that the OPUC (Oregon Public Utility Commission) approved to test different storage solutions to learn more about the most efficient and effective ways to store power and further modernize our grid.\nHow does the pilot work?, PGE will schedule times for your battery to be dispatched to provide energy at times of peak energy usage when prices are higher and electricity may be more carbon intensive. During these peak time events you always have the option to opt out and your batteries remain fully available to you during a power outage.\nWill PGE discharge my battery during an outage?, No batteries are not dispatched during an outage event. All batteries remain fully available to customers during a power outage. PGE monitors weather conditions very closely and in the event that severe weather is predicted that may be more likely to cause outages your battery will not be dispatched for grid purposes. Preserving customer resilience from their battery investment is among our top priorities of this pilot.\nHow do I get a battery if I don't already have one?, Contact an Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally for a bid on a battery storage system. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit. Your installer will guide you through the process of installing your battery system and connecting it to our grid. After your battery is installed you\u2019ll receive a link to connect your battery to PGE. That\u2019s it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to allow PGE to operate a residential energy storage battery?, Participating customers allow PGE to interact with and operate their batteries through cloud-based software. This software works as a load management system allows the dispatching of energy and offsets some stress from the grid during peak times. In a power outage the participating customer retains full battery usage as a power backup. They are always in control to opt-out or override any PGE event.\nHow is PGE working with Energy Trust of Oregon?, PGE is partnering with the Energy Trust of Oregon to procure residential battery storage systems for eligible residential customers by leveraging their existing solar incentive program infrastructure and trade ally contract network.\n\nAn Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally can provide a bid on a new battery system.

You could replace the dryer while you're at it. ENERGY STAR products use 10 to 50 percent less energy and water than standard models. 3) If your dishwasher is ten or older it might be time to replace it with an energy-efficient model. 4) Fridges washers and dishwashers are significant energy users. Other appliances still running well won't make that much of a difference in savings. 5) Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash-back incentives on select front-load clothes washers. Those that qualify are usually the most efficient but not all ENERGY STAR models qualify.\nWhat are EV charging options?, Ninety percent of EV owners charge at home which can be done by simply plugging into a wall outlet or installing a Level 2 home charger. If you cannot charge at home Oregon has nearly 1250 public charging stations with seven charging networks including PGE's electric Avenues. If you're new to electric cars or want to understand charging better we recommend using the Chargeway app. Chargeway customizes results that fit vehicles' preferences so that you can find quick convenient charging anywhere.\nHow are EV compared to Gas?, You've come to the perfect place to start exploring the wide range of electric vehicles available the rebates and incentives offered and even your EV charging options as you add up how much you could save by going electric.

For example you may have higher use in summer because of air conditioning or in the winter due to electric heating. This will determine your home\u2019s energy usage baseline or \u201cTypical Use.\u201d\n\nStep 4: We subtract the total kilowatt hours you use during the Peak Time Event or \u201cActual Event Use\u201d from your \u201cTypical Use\u201d as shown in the calculation below. If your energy use during the event is less than your Typical Use you earn a rebate at a rate of $1.00 per kilowatt hour.\n\n\nCustomer rebate baseline and rebate calculation:\n\n(Typical Use + Weather Adjustment) \u2013 Actual Event Use = kWh Savings\n\nkWh Savings x $1.00 = Rebate\n\nExample with Peak Time Event data and rebate:\n\n(3.67 kWh + 1.1 kWh) \u2013 2.21 kWh = 2.56 kWh\n\n2.56 kWh x $1.00/kWh = $2.56 (Rebate amount that would appear on your bill)\nHow will I know if I earned a rebate after a Peak Time Event?, When you enroll in the program you have the choice to be notified by email and/or text. After each Peak Time Event you will receive a message one to three days later to let you know if you earned a rebate and for how much. If you earned a rebate this amount will appear as a credit on your next bill.\nWhat if I don't participate in a Peak Time Event?, Your participation is completely voluntary. Once you\u2019re enrolled you're eligible for a bill credit during any event where you successfully reduce your energy use. If you aren't able to save energy during an event you'll still be enrolled and have other opportunities to participate in the future. Your health and safety should always come first so please consider any health impacts when reducing your energy use.\nI did my best to shift my energy use but didn't receive a rebate. How come?, If you're a customer who doesn't use much electricity on a daily basis it may be more difficult to reduce your use during Peak Time Events. Turning off lights or waiting to charge your phone won't make much of an impact during a Peak Time Event. You can make the biggest impact by reducing the use of major appliances using less hot water and turning your thermostat down a few degrees if you have electric heat or air conditioning.\nWhere will Peak Time Rebates credits appear on my bill and how often?, Peak Time Rebates will appear in the \u201cAdditional Charges/Credits\u201d area of your bill as \u201cpeak time credits.\u201d Rebates should appear on the next bill you receive after the Peak Time Event.\nCan I be enrolled in Peak Time Rebates as well as the PGE Smart Thermostat program?, Unfortunately no \u2014 you can't be in both programs at once.

Through this program PGE partners with residential customers with home battery storage systems. The program seeks to install and connect residential energy storage batteries that will contribute up to 9.5 megawatt hours of energy to our grid. Once installed these battery storage systems will help create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that is made up of residential battery systems that can be operated individually or combined to serve the grid adding flexibility that supports our transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition these home battery storage systems provide customers with a backup energy resource they can rely on in the event of a power outage.\nWhy is PGE doing this?, As we build a cleaner energy future and add more renewable power like wind and solar to our mix we\u2019re developing energy storage so we can make the best use of these more intermittent resources. This is one of five projects that the OPUC (Oregon Public Utility Commission) approved to test different storage solutions to learn more about the most efficient and effective ways to store power and further modernize our grid.\nHow does the pilot work?, PGE will schedule times for your battery to be dispatched to provide energy at times of peak energy usage when prices are higher and electricity may be more carbon intensive. During these peak time events you always have the option to opt out and your batteries remain fully available to you during a power outage.\nWill PGE discharge my battery during an outage?, No batteries are not dispatched during an outage event. All batteries remain fully available to customers during a power outage. PGE monitors weather conditions very closely and in the event that severe weather is predicted that may be more likely to cause outages your battery will not be dispatched for grid purposes. Preserving customer resilience from their battery investment is among our top priorities of this pilot.\nHow do I get a battery if I don't already have one?, Contact an Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally for a bid on a battery storage system. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit. Your installer will guide you through the process of installing your battery system and connecting it to our grid. After your battery is installed you'll receive a link to connect your battery to PGE. That\u2019s it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to allow PGE to operate a residential energy storage battery?, Participating customers allow PGE to interact with and operate their batteries through cloud-based software. This software works as a load management system allows the dispatching of energy and offsets some stress from the grid during peak times. In a power outage the participating customer retains full battery usage as a power backup. They are always in control to opt-out or override any PGE event.\nHow is PGE working with Energy Trust of Oregon?, PGE is partnering with the Energy Trust of Oregon to procure residential battery storage systems for eligible residential customers by leveraging their existing solar incentive program infrastructure and trade ally contract network.\n\nAn Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally can provide a bid on a new battery system. You can include solar if you\u2019d like although it\u2019s not required for this rebate.\nWhat else does PGE hope to learn through this program?, PGE will use the residential battery storage pilot to create a single resource that can help the grid balance energy production with energy demand freeing up the generation resources that are typically held on standby ready to kick in and accommodate significant fluctuation. This will allow generation resources that are typically fossil-fueled to do what they do most efficiently \u2013 generate energy.\nThe pilot will also allow PGE to test new smart-grid control devices across its distribution system that will more effectively allow a two-way exchange between PGE and pilot participants. The new controls will more actively manage the way that electricity is distributed across PGE\u2019s system to incorporate energy that customers generate such as through solar panels while also meeting power demand that is less predictable such as for charging electric vehicles. The controls will allow PGE to more actively manage power distribution to improve power quality for all customers.\nHow often will PGE use my battery?, The pilot estimates the batteries will be dispatched about 15 times per year typically occurring during times of extreme heat or cold when there is more strain on the grid. Due to the experimental nature of the pilot PGE may also send signals for technical testing purposes.", "start_char_idx": 155428, "end_char_idx": 160837, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0a968fa-95de-4de5-9417-0afacaaa9eb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0a968fa-95de-4de5-9417-0afacaaa9eb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\adria\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Github repos\\BANA577-Capstone\\combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_name": "combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_type": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "file_size": 172049, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "file_path", "file_name"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "file_path", "file_name"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "160a4f13-7b42-4386-a6e5-e18da52055ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\adria\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Github repos\\BANA577-Capstone\\combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_name": "combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_type": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "file_size": 172049, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "391221ff4e9dec9643264f2a4730f4402b2f352e721e7cddefda949c3b7d5fa6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99c664bb-3812-4188-81fc-dfacfbcf4842", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\adria\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Github repos\\BANA577-Capstone\\combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_name": "combined_data_cleaned.csv", "file_type": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "file_size": 172049, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "10c053038fd0f262aa7c2c4e23221c4c1f7787d6a0d1c2907bb42834dbf9f151", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20dd8637-7cdb-4f9e-bcbf-f0064f8f30f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4b0b451d7ea44309d20e6c7d30a2030a018046caed6cbd40d0182b0af202565", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This will allow generation resources that are typically fossil-fueled to do what they do most efficiently \u2013 generate energy.\nThe pilot will also allow PGE to test new smart-grid control devices across its distribution system that will more effectively allow a two-way exchange between PGE and pilot participants.

Due to the experimental nature of the pilot PGE may also send signals for technical testing purposes. You are always in control and can opt out of any PGE dispatch.\nWhy should you consider joining our Smart Battery pilot?, PGE\u2019s Smart Battery pilot studies the best ways to connect batteries at customer homes to PGE's grid. At times of peak energy usage (usually the hottest and coldest days of the year) we\u2019ll charge or discharge your battery to either store or provide energy to the grid \u2013 about 10-15 times per year. Your batteries will remain fully available to you during a power outage or upon request and you're always in control of how much energy you wish to contribute.\nWho qualifies for the Smart Battery pilot?, If you have one of the battery systems listed below you can enroll in our Smart Battery pilot and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh for each Peak Time Event you participate in.\n\nTesla PGE\nSolarEdge PGE\nEnphase PGE\nGenerac PGE\nFranklinWH PGE\nSonnen PGE\nDuracell PGE\nEguana PGE\nWhat if I have a battery that's not on the qualifies list?, You can use your current battery system as a great way to save on your bill when you participate in Peak Time Rebates.\n\nSimply program your battery to provide some or all of the energy your home needs during a Peak Time Event.\nWhat benefits can I get from a Smart Battery pilot program?, Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash incentives for solar + battery storage and for batteries added to existing solar systems including higher incentives for income-qualified households. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit.\n\nWhy does my participation in this pilot matter?, By adding your battery system to the grid you're part of a community that is creating a \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d - one that lets us store and draws energy when needed. It\u2019s an important step towards a clean energy future and a vital one as we add more renewables like wind and solar to the grid.\n\nFor example if our solar panels or wind turbines are generating more than usual we can store this extra clean energy in batteries and use it later to power your neighbors\u2019 homes and businesses. That strengthens reliability and makes us better equipped to incorporate more low-cost renewable energy sources into the grid.\nWhich paths can I take to be a part of this pilot?, You can choose the amount of kWh you wish to allow PGE to use of your battery during a scheduled Peak Time Event and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh per event. This gives you options when it comes to optimizing resilience based on your own comfort level. Each tier is based on a percentage of your battery\u2019s total nameplate capacity.\n\nNo matter which tier you choose your battery system will remain fully available to you during a power outage. Preserving the resilience you receive from your battery system is among our top priorities.\nHow does the amount of bill credit vary based on the percentage of battery capacity shared during Peak Time Events?, The amount of bill credit received during each event depends on the actual amount of energy your battery provides during each Peak Time Event. This chart includes examples of potential bill credits a customer would receive sharing 80% of their capacity and participating in Peak Time Events.\nHow do I apply for a job at PGE?, To apply for a position at PGE you must submit your resume/application electronically for each job posting that interests you.
