<td>The Smart Thermostat Program is a fantastic way to manage your energy use efficiently. By enrolling your thermostat will automatically shift some of your energy use away from peak times when energy demand is high known as Peak Time Events. These events occur typically 8 to 9 times each summer and 5 to 6 times each winter lasting between 1 to 4 hours. During these events your thermostat automatically adjusts by a few degrees. This subtle adjustment helps you save on your energy bills supports more sustainable energy use and keeps the energy grid reliable. You’ll earn up to $25 for signing up plus an additional $25 on your PGE bill each summer and winter season you participate. Best of all you’re always in control of your comfort and can override the thermostat’s settings if you prefer a different temperature.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>How are Peak Time Rebates calculated?</td>
<td>Your energy use baseline is calculated from your average use over the past 10 similar days during the same hours as the Peak Time Event. You earn $1 per kilowatt hour (kWh) when you reduce below your baseline during a Peak Time Event. <br/><br/>The calculation in four steps:<br/><br/>Step 1: PGE looks at the 10 most recent days that are similar in type (weekday or weekend). . Holidays or any previous Peak Time Event days are not considered similar days and are not included in establishing the 10-day baseline period.<br/><br/>Step 2: Using the selected 10 days for your baseline period PGE identifies your home’s average use during the same hours as the Peak Time Event.So if the upcoming Peak Time Event is from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m. PGE will determine your home’s average use during the hours of 4:00 -7:00 p.m.<br/><br/>Step 3: Because the weather on the Peak Time Event day may not be exactly the same as the 10 days selected for the baseline period PGE applies an adjustment for the difference in temperature for some customers if your historical usage indicates a significant difference in electrical use when the temperature changes. For example you may have higher use in summer because of air conditioning or in the winter due to electric heating. This will determine your home’s energy usage baseline or “Typical Use.”<br/><br/>Step 4: We subtract the total kilowatt hours you use during the Peak Time Event or “Actual Event Use” from your “Typical Use” as shown in the calculation below. If your energy use during the event is less than your Typical Use you earn a rebate at a rate of $1.00 per kilowatt hour.<br/><br/><br/>Customer rebate baseline and rebate calculation:<br/><br/>(Typical Use + Weather Adjustment) – Actual Event Use = kWh Savings<br/><br/>kWh Savings x $1.00 = Rebate<br/><br/>Example with Peak Time Event data and rebate:<br/><br/>(3.67 kWh + 1.1 kWh) – 2.21 kWh = 2.56 kWh<br/><br/>2.56 kWh x $1.00/kWh = $2.56 (Rebate amount that would appear on your bill)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How will I know if I earned a rebate after a Peak Time Event?</td>
<td>When you enroll in the program you have the choice to be notified by email and/or text. After each Peak Time Event you will receive a message one to three days later to let you know if you earned a rebate and for how much. If you earned a rebate this amount will appear as a credit on your next bill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What if I don&#39;t participate in a Peak Time Event?</td>
<td>Your participation is completely voluntary. Once you’re enrolled you’re eligible for a bill credit during any event where you successfully reduce your energy use. If you aren’t able to save energy during an event you’ll still be enrolled and have other opportunities to participate in the future. Your health and safety should always come first so please consider any health impacts when reducing your energy use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I did my best to shift my energy use but didn&#39;t receive a rebate. How come?</td>
<td>If you’re a customer who doesn’t use much electricity on a daily basis it may be more difficult to reduce your use during Peak Time Events. Turning off lights or waiting to charge your phone won’t make much of an impact during a Peak Time Event. You can make the biggest impact by reducing the use of major appliances using less hot water and turning your thermostat down a few degrees if you have electric heat or air conditioning.</td>

<tr>
<td>What is the Smart Battery pilot?</td>
<td>PGE launched its five-year Smart Battery pilot in 2020. Through this program PGE partners with residential customers with home battery storage systems. The program seeks to install and connect residential energy storage batteries that will contribute up to 9.5 megawatt hours of energy to our grid. Once installed these battery storage systems will help create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that is made up of residential battery systems that can be operated individually or combined to serve the grid adding flexibility that supports our transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition these home battery storage systems provide customers with a backup energy resource they can rely on in the event of a power outage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why is PGE doing this?</td>
<td>As we build a cleaner energy future and add more renewable power like wind and solar to our mix we’re developing energy storage so we can make the best use of these more intermittent resources. This is one of five projects that the OPUC (Oregon Public Utility Commission) approved to test different storage solutions to learn more about the most efficient and effective ways to store power and further modernize our grid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How does the pilot work?</td>
<td>PGE will schedule times for your battery to be dispatched to provide energy at times of peak energy usage when prices are higher and electricity may be more carbon intensive. During these peak time events you always have the option to opt out and your batteries remain fully available to you during a power outage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will PGE discharge my battery during an outage?</td>
<td>No batteries are not dispatched during an outage event. All batteries remain fully available to customers during a power outage. PGE monitors weather conditions very closely and in the event that severe weather is predicted that may be more likely to cause outages your battery will not be dispatched for grid purposes. Preserving customer resilience from their battery investment is among our top priorities of this pilot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How do I get a battery if I don&#39;t already have one?</td>
<td>Contact an Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally for a bid on a battery storage system. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit. Your installer will guide you through the process of installing your battery system and connecting it to our grid. After your battery is installed you’ll receive a link to connect your battery to PGE. That’s it! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What does it mean to allow PGE to operate a residential energy storage battery?</td>
<td>Participating customers allow PGE to interact with and operate their batteries through cloud-based software. This software works as a load management system allows the dispatching of energy and offsets some stress from the grid during peak times. In a power outage the participating customer retains full battery usage as a power backup. They are always in control to opt-out or override any PGE event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How is PGE working with Energy Trust of Oregon?</td>
<td>PGE is partnering with the Energy Trust of Oregon to procure residential battery storage systems for eligible residential customers by leveraging their existing solar incentive program infrastructure and trade ally contract network.<br/><br/>An Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally can provide a bid on a new battery system. You can include solar if you’d like although it’s not required for this rebate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What else does PGE hope to learn through this program?</td>
<td>PGE will use the residential battery storage pilot to create a single resource that can help the grid balance energy production with energy demand freeing up the generation resources that are typically held on standby ready to kick in and accommodate significant fluctuation. This will allow generation resources that are typically fossil-fueled to do what they do most efficiently – generate energy.<br/>The pilot will also allow PGE to test new smart-grid control devices across its distribution system that will more effectively allow a two-way exchange between PGE and pilot participants. The new controls will more actively manage the way that electricity is distributed across PGE’s system to incorporate energy that customers generate such as through solar panels while also meeting power demand that is less predictable such as for charging electric vehicles. The controls will allow PGE to more actively manage power distribution to improve power quality for all customers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How often will PGE use my battery?</td>
<td>The pilot estimates the batteries will be dispatched about 15 times per year typically occurring during times of extreme heat or cold when there is more strain on the grid. Due to the experimental nature of the pilot PGE may also send signals for technical testing purposes. You are always in control and can opt out of any PGE dispatch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why should you consider joining our Smart Battery pilot?</td>
<td>PGE’s Smart Battery pilot studies the best ways to connect batteries at customer homes to PGE&#39;s grid. At times of peak energy usage (usually the hottest and coldest days of the year) we’ll charge or discharge your battery to either store or provide energy to the grid – about 10-15 times per year. Your batteries will remain fully available to you during a power outage or upon request and you’re always in control of how much energy you wish to contribute.</td>

<td>What if I have a battery that&#39;s not on the qualifies list?</td>
<td>You can use your current battery system as a great way to save on your bill when you participate in Peak Time Rebates.<br/><br/>Simply program your battery to provide some or all of the energy your home needs during a Peak Time Event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What benefits can I get from a Smart Battery pilot program?</td>
<td>Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash incentives for solar + battery storage and for batteries added to existing solar systems including higher incentives for income-qualified households. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit.<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why does my participation in this pilot matter?</td>
<td>By adding your battery system to the grid you’re part of a community that is creating a “virtual power plant” - one that lets us store and draws energy when needed. It’s an important step towards a clean energy future and a vital one as we add more renewables like wind and solar to the grid.<br/><br/>For example if our solar panels or wind turbines are generating more than usual we can store this extra clean energy in batteries and use it later to power your neighbors’ homes and businesses. That strengthens reliability and makes us better equipped to incorporate more low-cost renewable energy sources into the grid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Which paths can I take to be a part of this pilot?</td>
<td>You can choose the amount of kWh you wish to allow PGE to use of your battery during a scheduled Peak Time Event and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh per event. This gives you options when it comes to optimizing resilience based on your own comfort level. Each tier is based on a percentage of your battery’s total nameplate capacity.<br/><br/>No matter which tier you choose your battery system will remain fully available to you during a power outage. Preserving the resilience you receive from your battery system is among our top priorities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How does the amount of bill credit vary based on the percentage of battery capacity shared during Peak Time Events?</td>

<tr>
<td>How are Peak Time Rebates calculated?</td>
<td>Your energy use baseline is calculated from your average use over the past 10 similar days during the same hours as the Peak Time Event. You earn $1 per kilowatt hour (kWh) when you reduce below your baseline during a Peak Time Event. <br/><br/>The calculation in four steps:<br/><br/>Step 1: PGE looks at the 10 most recent days that are similar in type (weekday or weekend). . Holidays or any previous Peak Time Event days are not considered similar days and are not included in establishing the 10-day baseline period.<br/><br/>Step 2: Using the selected 10 days for your baseline period PGE identifies your home’s average use during the same hours as the Peak Time Event.So if the upcoming Peak Time Event is from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m. PGE will determine your home’s average use during the hours of 4:00 -7:00 p.m.<br/><br/>Step 3: Because the weather on the Peak Time Event day may not be exactly the same as the 10 days selected for the baseline period PGE applies an adjustment for the difference in temperature for some customers if your historical usage indicates a significant difference in electrical use when the temperature changes. For example you may have higher use in summer because of air conditioning or in the winter due to electric heating. This will determine your home’s energy usage baseline or “Typical Use.”<br/><br/>Step 4: We subtract the total kilowatt hours you use during the Peak Time Event or “Actual Event Use” from your “Typical Use” as shown in the calculation below. If your energy use during the event is less than your Typical Use you earn a rebate at a rate of $1.00 per kilowatt hour.<br/><br/><br/>Customer rebate baseline and rebate calculation:<br/><br/>(Typical Use + Weather Adjustment) – Actual Event Use = kWh Savings<br/><br/>kWh Savings x $1.00 = Rebate<br/><br/>Example with Peak Time Event data and rebate:<br/><br/>(3.67 kWh + 1.1 kWh) – 2.21 kWh = 2.56 kWh<br/><br/>2.56 kWh x $1.00/kWh = $2.56 (Rebate amount that would appear on your bill)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How will I know if I earned a rebate after a Peak Time Event?</td>
<td>When you enroll in the program you have the choice to be notified by email and/or text.

<tr>
<td>What is the Smart Battery pilot?</td>
<td>PGE launched its five-year Smart Battery pilot in 2020. Through this program PGE partners with residential customers with home battery storage systems. The program seeks to install and connect residential energy storage batteries that will contribute up to 9.5 megawatt hours of energy to our grid. Once installed these battery storage systems will help create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that is made up of residential battery systems that can be operated individually or combined to serve the grid adding flexibility that supports our transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition these home battery storage systems provide customers with a backup energy resource they can rely on in the event of a power outage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why is PGE doing this?</td>
<td>As we build a cleaner energy future and add more renewable power like wind and solar to our mix we’re developing energy storage so we can make the best use of these more intermittent resources. This is one of five projects that the OPUC (Oregon Public Utility Commission) approved to test different storage solutions to learn more about the most efficient and effective ways to store power and further modernize our grid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How does the pilot work?</td>
<td>PGE will schedule times for your battery to be dispatched to provide energy at times of peak energy usage when prices are higher and electricity may be more carbon intensive. During these peak time events you always have the option to opt out and your batteries remain fully available to you during a power outage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will PGE discharge my battery during an outage?</td>
<td>No batteries are not dispatched during an outage event. All batteries remain fully available to customers during a power outage. PGE monitors weather conditions very closely and in the event that severe weather is predicted that may be more likely to cause outages your battery will not be dispatched for grid purposes. Preserving customer resilience from their battery investment is among our top priorities of this pilot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How do I get a battery if I don&#39;t already have one?</td>
<td>Contact an Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally for a bid on a battery storage system. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit. Your installer will guide you through the process of installing your battery system and connecting it to our grid. After your battery is installed you&#39;ll receive a link to connect your battery to PGE. That’s it! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What does it mean to allow PGE to operate a residential energy storage battery?</td>
<td>Participating customers allow PGE to interact with and operate their batteries through cloud-based software. This software works as a load management system allows the dispatching of energy and offsets some stress from the grid during peak times. In a power outage the participating customer retains full battery usage as a power backup. They are always in control to opt-out or override any PGE event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How is PGE working with Energy Trust of Oregon?</td>
<td>PGE is partnering with the Energy Trust of Oregon to procure residential battery storage systems for eligible residential customers by leveraging their existing solar incentive program infrastructure and trade ally contract network.<br/><br/>An Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally can provide a bid on a new battery system. You can include solar if you’d like although it’s not required for this rebate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What else does PGE hope to learn through this program?</td>
<td>PGE will use the residential battery storage pilot to create a single resource that can help the grid balance energy production with energy demand freeing up the generation resources that are typically held on standby ready to kick in and accommodate significant fluctuation. This will allow generation resources that are typically fossil-fueled to do what they do most efficiently – generate energy.<br/>The pilot will also allow PGE to test new smart-grid control devices across its distribution system that will more effectively allow a two-way exchange between PGE and pilot participants. The new controls will more actively manage the way that electricity is distributed across PGE’s system to incorporate energy that customers generate such as through solar panels while also meeting power demand that is less predictable such as for charging electric vehicles. The controls will allow PGE to more actively manage power distribution to improve power quality for all customers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How often will PGE use my battery?</td>
<td>The pilot estimates the batteries will be dispatched about 15 times per year typically occurring during times of extreme heat or cold when there is more strain on the grid. Due to the experimental nature of the pilot PGE may also send signals for technical testing purposes. You are always in control and can opt out of any PGE dispatch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why should you consider joining our Smart Battery pilot?</td>
<td>PGE’s Smart Battery pilot studies the best ways to connect batteries at customer homes to PGE&#39;s grid. At times of peak energy usage (usually the hottest and coldest days of the year) we’ll charge or discharge your battery to either store or provide energy to the grid – about 10-15 times per year. Your batteries will remain fully available to you during a power outage or upon request and you&#39;re always in control of how much energy you wish to contribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Who qualifies for the Smart Battery pilot?</td>
<td>If you have one of the battery systems listed below you can enroll in our Smart Battery pilot and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh for each Peak Time Event you participate in.<br/><br/>Tesla PGE<br/>SolarEdge PGE<br/>Enphase PGE<br/>Generac PGE<br/>FranklinWH PGE<br/>Sonnen PGE<br/>Duracell PGE<br/>Eguana PGE</td>

<td>You can use your current battery system as a great way to save on your bill when you participate in Peak Time Rebates.<br/><br/>Simply program your battery to provide some or all of the energy your home needs during a Peak Time Event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What benefits can I get from a Smart Battery pilot program?</td>
<td>Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash incentives for solar + battery storage and for batteries added to existing solar systems including higher incentives for income-qualified households. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit.<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why does my participation in this pilot matter?</td>
<td>By adding your battery system to the grid you&#39;re part of a community that is creating a “virtual power plant” - one that lets us store and draws energy when needed. It’s an important step towards a clean energy future and a vital one as we add more renewables like wind and solar to the grid.<br/><br/>For example if our solar panels or wind turbines are generating more than usual we can store this extra clean energy in batteries and use it later to power your neighbors’ homes and businesses. That strengthens reliability and makes us better equipped to incorporate more low-cost renewable energy sources into the grid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Which paths can I take to be a part of this pilot?</td>
<td>You can choose the amount of kWh you wish to allow PGE to use of your battery during a scheduled Peak Time Event and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh per event. This gives you options when it comes to optimizing resilience based on your own comfort level. Each tier is based on a percentage of your battery’s total nameplate capacity.<br/><br/>No matter which tier you choose your battery system will remain fully available to you during a power outage. Preserving the resilience you receive from your battery system is among our top priorities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How does the amount of bill credit vary based on the percentage of battery capacity shared during Peak Time Events?</td>
<td>The amount of bill credit received during each event depends on the actual amount of energy your battery provides during each Peak Time Event. This chart includes examples of potential bill credits a customer would receive sharing 80% of their capacity and participating in Peak Time Events.</td>
