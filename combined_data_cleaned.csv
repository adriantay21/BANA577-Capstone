How much does it cost to participate in Green Future Choice?,"Your cost is based on how much energy you use each month. Residential customers pay about $7 more on average per month (~$13 for small businesses) to match 100% of their electricity use.* You’ll pay almost a penny more per kWh.
* Average renewable customer energy use is about 795 kWh per month for homes about 1350 kWh per month for small businesses."
Is Green Future Choice certified by any third-party organizations?,Yes Green Future Choice is Green-e Energy certified and meets the environmental and consumer protection standards set forth by the nonprofit Center for Resource Solutions. Customers can learn more at green-e.org
What are some benefits of signing up for Green Future Choice or Green Future Block?,When you sign up for Green Future Choice or Green Future Block you’re joining the largest voluntary renewable energy program in the nation. You’re not just helping build a clean energy future you’re also helping create local jobs build solar projects right in the community and support underserved communities through the PGE Renewable Development Fund.
What is the Oregon Community Solar Program and who can participate?,The Oregon Community Solar Program is a new offering that brings small solar projects to communities throughout the state. Best of all it’s available to everyone even if you rent your home or lease your business space.
What is Habitat Support and how can customers add it to their Green Future renewable power option?,Habitat Support is an option to help the Nature Conservancy restore local fish habitat.

How can I save on my bill?,You can save by reducing your energy use at peak times it supports the use of more sustainable energy resources and helps keep costs lower for the community. Here are some ways you can save.: 1) Time of day saving. 2) Peak time rebates. 3) Smart thermostat program https://portlandgeneral.com/save-money/save-money-home
Can I get help on high bills?,An unexpectedly high energy bill can be a shock. We can work with you to help you pay off the balance of that bill. Please visit the high bill help portal for more information on the tips.
Can I set a budget for my bill?,Yes you can get weekly bill estimates and alerts when your bill is getting close to exceeding your budget. 
How to track energy use?,You can use our free Energy Tracker to see when you're using the most energy** and how to cut back. 
What are the discounts and special offers?,Hurray we’ve got your back! Check with our partners and programs before you make an energy-saving purchase – there are lots of ways to save money. Please visit the discount and special offers section on our website. 
What is the he most effective place to reduce high energy bills?,Changing the way you heat (and cool) your home is one of the most effective ways to lower your energy bill. And you don’t have to suffer in the bitter cold or sweltering heat — there are lots of ways to stay comfortable without breaking the bank. Fans are one way to cool the house down in the summer or keep air circulating in the winter without paying a lot. Heat pumps can save you even more.
Is there any way to save energy on water heater?,Water heater is the second biggest energy hog. If your water heater is 10 to 15 years old it’s probably time to replace it. You’ll save the most in energy costs if you get heat pump water heater. Not ready to replace your water heater? Fear not follow: https://portlandgeneral.com/save-money/save-money-home/water-heaters
What is the Smart Thermostat program? ,When you enroll in the program your thermostat will automatically shift some of your energy use away from peak times when energy demand is high. There are typically 8 to 9 Peak Time Events each summer and 5 to 6 in winter. Events typically last 1 to 4 hours. 
What are the best ways to save with appliances? ,1) Refrigerators are the biggest energy users in your kitchen. Vintage is cool but if your refrigerator is pre-1993 it’s very inefficient. A newer model could result in significant savings. 2) If you wash with hot water you’ll save by upgrading. Might as well replace the dryer while you're at it. ENERGY STAR products use 10 to 50 percent less energy and water than standard models. 3) If your dishwasher is 10 years old or older it might be time to replace it with an energy-efficient model. 4) Fridges washers and dishwashers are the big energy users. Other appliances that are still running well won't make that much of a difference in savings. 5) Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash-back incentives on select front-load clothes washers. Those that qualify are usually the most efficient but not all ENERGY STAR models qualify.
What are EV charging options?,"Ninety percent of EV owners charge at home which can be done by simply plugging into a wall outlet or by installing a Level 2 home charger. If you’re unable to charge at home Oregon has nearly 1250 public charging stations with seven charging networks including PGE's electric Avenues.
If you’re new to electric cars or just want to understand charging better we recommend using the Chargeway app. Chargeway customizes results that fit vehicles’ preferences so you can find quick convenient charging anywhere."
How are EV compared to Gas?,You've come to the perfect place to start exploring the wide range of electric vehicles available the rebates and incentives offered and even your EV charging options as you add up how much you could save by going electric. Find the calculator here: https://portlandgeneral.com/energy-choices/electric-vehicles-charging/ready-to-buy-an-ev/electric-vehicle-costs-and-savings-calculator 
What are the benefits of EV charging station at home? ,It’s easy to earn rewards while doing good for the environment and helping us build a more efficient and resilient grid. Enrolling in Smart Charging comes with rebates for purchasing and installing a qualifying Level 2 home EV charger plus ongoing bill credits. 
How does the smart charging works?,"1) Your charger will automatically shift its charging schedule away from peak times when energy use is high and sustainable energy resources are scarcer. We call these Smart Charging Events. 
2) During these events your charger will pause your vehicle's charging. It will start again once the event is over. You can opt out of any event via your charging app.
3) When you participate you can earn a $25 credit on your bill at the end of a Smart Charging season (October to March and April to September)."
How easy is it to charge?,"Let’s put it this way – charging your EV is easier than filling up at a gas station because you can do it at home or on the go! And if you want to charge faster you can install a Level 2 charger in your garage or visit a DC Fast Charger around town. 
1) Level I : Power: Typically 1.4 kW Charge Time: 3 – 5 miles of range per hour of charging.
2) Level II : Power: Typically 7 – 12 kW Charge Time: ~25 miles of range per hour.

How to save money with weatherization?,"1. Pull the shades.
Yep it’s that simple. Window coverings help hold heat in and cold out.
2. Close your fireplace damper and doors. Only close up when you don’t have a fire lit and it’s a good idea to let the fireplace cool completely before closing the damper.
3. Get your fireplace a pillow.
Yes fireplace pillows or chimney balloons are a thing. They inflate in your chimney to block drafts (and noise soot and debris).
4. Install weather stripping around doors. Seal gaps and keep drafts at bay.
5. Add or repair insulation in roofs and walls. Not an easy fix but the benefits in energy savings could offset the work and expense."

You can update your notification preferences on the Peak Time Rebates webpage or call PGE Customer Service at 800-542-8818.
How are Peak Time Rebates calculated?,"Your energy use baseline is calculated from your average use over the past 10 similar days during the same hours as the Peak Time Event. You earn $1 per kilowatt hour (kWh) when you reduce below your baseline during a Peak Time Event. 

The calculation in four steps:

Step 1: PGE looks at the 10 most recent days that are similar in type (weekday or weekend). . Holidays or any previous Peak Time Event days are not considered similar days and are not included in establishing the 10-day baseline period.

Step 2: Using the selected 10 days for your baseline period PGE identifies your home’s average use during the same hours as the Peak Time Event.So if the upcoming Peak Time Event is from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m. PGE will determine your home’s average use during the hours of 4:00 -7:00 p.m.

Step 3: Because the weather on the Peak Time Event day may not be exactly the same as the 10 days selected for the baseline period PGE applies an adjustment for the difference in temperature for some customers if your historical usage indicates a significant difference in electrical use when the temperature changes. For example you may have higher use in summer because of air conditioning or in the winter due to electric heating. This will determine your home’s energy usage baseline or “Typical Use.”

Step 4: We subtract the total kilowatt hours you use during the Peak Time Event or “Actual Event Use” from your “Typical Use” as shown in the calculation below. If your energy use during the event is less than your Typical Use you earn a rebate at a rate of $1.00 per kilowatt hour.


Customer rebate baseline and rebate calculation:

(Typical Use + Weather Adjustment) – Actual Event Use = kWh Savings

kWh Savings x $1.00 = Rebate

Example with Peak Time Event data and rebate:

(3.67 kWh + 1.1 kWh) – 2.21 kWh = 2.56 kWh

2.56 kWh x $1.00/kWh = $2.56 (Rebate amount that would appear on your bill)"
How will I know if I earned a rebate after a Peak Time Event?,When you enroll in the program you have the choice to be notified by email and/or text. After each Peak Time Event you will receive a message one to three days later to let you know if you earned a rebate and for how much. If you earned a rebate this amount will appear as a credit on your next bill.
What if I don't participate in a Peak Time Event?,Your participation is completely voluntary. Once you’re enrolled you’re eligible for a bill credit during any event where you successfully reduce your energy use. If you aren’t able to save energy during an event you’ll still be enrolled and have other opportunities to participate in the future. Your health and safety should always come first so please consider any health impacts when reducing your energy use.
I did my best to shift my energy use but didn't receive a rebate. How come?,If you’re a customer who doesn’t use much electricity on a daily basis it may be more difficult to reduce your use during Peak Time Events. Turning off lights or waiting to charge your phone won’t make much of an impact during a Peak Time Event. You can make the biggest impact by reducing the use of major appliances using less hot water and turning your thermostat down a few degrees if you have electric heat or air conditioning.
Where will Peak Time Rebates credits appear on my bill and how often?,Peak Time Rebates will appear in the “Additional Charges/Credits” area of your bill as “peak time credits.” Rebates should appear on the next bill you receive after the Peak Time Event.
Can I be enrolled in Peak Time Rebates as well as the PGE Smart Thermostat program?,Unfortunately no — you can't be in both programs at once.

During an event you can reduce your energy use with simple changes like waiting to wash dishes or do laundry and adjusting your temperature setting a few degrees.

3. Earn rebates
If you reduce your energy use during the Peak Time Event you can earn a rebate on your next bill."
What is the Smart Battery pilot?,PGE launched its five-year Smart Battery pilot in 2020. Through this program PGE partners with residential customers with home battery storage systems. The program seeks to install and connect residential energy storage batteries that will contribute up to 9.5 megawatt hours of energy to our grid. Once installed these battery storage systems will help create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that is made up of residential battery systems that can be operated individually or combined to serve the grid adding flexibility that supports our transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition these home battery storage systems provide customers with a backup energy resource they can rely on in the event of a power outage.
Why is PGE doing this?,As we build a cleaner energy future and add more renewable power like wind and solar to our mix we’re developing energy storage so we can make the best use of these more intermittent resources. This is one of five projects that the OPUC (Oregon Public Utility Commission) approved to test different storage solutions to learn more about the most efficient and effective ways to store power and further modernize our grid.
How does the pilot work?,PGE will schedule times for your battery to be dispatched to provide energy at times of peak energy usage when prices are higher and electricity may be more carbon intensive. During these peak time events you always have the option to opt out and your batteries remain fully available to you during a power outage.
Will PGE discharge my battery during an outage?,No batteries are not dispatched during an outage event. All batteries remain fully available to customers during a power outage. PGE monitors weather conditions very closely and in the event that severe weather is predicted that may be more likely to cause outages your battery will not be dispatched for grid purposes. Preserving customer resilience from their battery investment is among our top priorities of this pilot.
How do I get a battery if I don't already have one?,"Contact an Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally for a bid on a battery storage system. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit. Your installer will guide you through the process of installing your battery system and connecting it to our grid. After your battery is installed you’ll receive a link to connect your battery to PGE. That’s it! 









"
What does it mean to allow PGE to operate a residential energy storage battery?,Participating customers allow PGE to interact with and operate their batteries through cloud-based software. This software works as a load management system allows the dispatching of energy and offsets some stress from the grid during peak times. In a power outage the participating customer retains full battery usage as a power backup. They are always in control to opt-out or override any PGE event.
How is PGE working with Energy Trust of Oregon?,"PGE is partnering with the Energy Trust of Oregon to procure residential battery storage systems for eligible residential customers by leveraging their existing solar incentive program infrastructure and trade ally contract network.

An Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally can provide a bid on a new battery system. You can include solar if you’d like although it’s not required for this rebate."
What else does PGE hope to learn through this program?,"PGE will use the residential battery storage pilot to create a single resource that can help the grid balance energy production with energy demand freeing up the generation resources that are typically held on standby ready to kick in and accommodate significant fluctuation. This will allow generation resources that are typically fossil-fueled to do what they do most efficiently – generate energy.
The pilot will also allow PGE to test new smart-grid control devices across its distribution system that will more effectively allow a two-way exchange between PGE and pilot participants. The new controls will more actively manage the way that electricity is distributed across PGE’s system to incorporate energy that customers generate such as through solar panels while also meeting power demand that is less predictable such as for charging electric vehicles. The controls will allow PGE to more actively manage power distribution to improve power quality for all customers."
How often will PGE use my battery?,The pilot estimates the batteries will be dispatched about 15 times per year typically occurring during times of extreme heat or cold when there is more strain on the grid. Due to the experimental nature of the pilot PGE may also send signals for technical testing purposes. You are always in control and can opt out of any PGE dispatch.
Why should you consider joining our Smart Battery pilot?,PGE’s Smart Battery pilot studies the best ways to connect batteries at customer homes to PGE's grid. At times of peak energy usage (usually the hottest and coldest days of the year) we’ll charge or discharge your battery to either store or provide energy to the grid – about 10-15 times per year. Your batteries will remain fully available to you during a power outage or upon request and you’re always in control of how much energy you wish to contribute.
Who qualifies for the Smart Battery pilot?,"If you have one of the battery systems listed below you can enroll in our Smart Battery pilot and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh for each Peak Time Event you participate in.

Tesla PGE
SolarEdge PGE
Enphase PGE
Generac PGE
FranklinWH PGE
Sonnen PGE
Duracell PGE
Eguana PGE"
What if I have a battery that's not on the qualifies list?,"You can use your current battery system as a great way to save on your bill when you participate in Peak Time Rebates.

Simply program your battery to provide some or all of the energy your home needs during a Peak Time Event."
What benefits can I get from a Smart Battery pilot program?,"Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash incentives for solar + battery storage and for batteries added to existing solar systems including higher incentives for income-qualified households. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit.
"
Why does my participation in this pilot matter?,"By adding your battery system to the grid you’re part of a community that is creating a “virtual power plant” - one that lets us store and draws energy when needed. It’s an important step towards a clean energy future and a vital one as we add more renewables like wind and solar to the grid.

For example if our solar panels or wind turbines are generating more than usual we can store this extra clean energy in batteries and use it later to power your neighbors’ homes and businesses. That strengthens reliability and makes us better equipped to incorporate more low-cost renewable energy sources into the grid."
Which paths can I take to be a part of this pilot?,"You can choose the amount of kWh you wish to allow PGE to use of your battery during a scheduled Peak Time Event and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh per event. This gives you options when it comes to optimizing resilience based on your own comfort level. Each tier is based on a percentage of your battery’s total nameplate capacity.

No matter which tier you choose your battery system will remain fully available to you during a power outage. Preserving the resilience you receive from your battery system is among our top priorities."
How does the amount of bill credit vary based on the percentage of battery capacity shared during Peak Time Events?,The amount of bill credit received during each event depends on the actual amount of energy your battery provides during each Peak Time Event. This chart includes examples of potential bill credits a customer would receive sharing 80% of their capacity and participating in Peak Time Events.

How to save money with weatherization?,"1. Pull the shades.
Yep it’s that simple. Window coverings help hold heat in and cold out.
2. Close your fireplace damper and doors. Only close up when you don't have a fire lit and it’s a good idea to let the fireplace cool completely before closing the damper.
3. Get your fireplace a pillow.
Yes fireplace pillows or chimney balloons are a thing. They inflate in your chimney to block drafts (and noise soot and debris).
4. Install weather stripping around doors. Seal gaps and keep drafts at bay.
5. Add or repair insulation in roofs and walls. Not an easy fix but the benefits in energy savings could offset the work and expense."

How will I know when a Peak Time Event is happening?,You'll receive email notifications from PGE and see alerts on your thermostat or smartphone app. These notifications ensure you're fully informed before and during the event.
What do I need to do during a Peak Time Event?,Your thermostat will pre-heat or pre-cool your home before the event when the demand for energy is lower. This means you'll stay comfortable even when the thermostat adjusts during the event. If you prefer not to participate you can manually adjust your settings at any time during the event.
How often do Peak Time Events occur?,Typically there are about 8 to 9 events each summer and 5 to 6 in the winter. We avoid scheduling these on holidays to ensure your comfort during those special times. Summer events usually occur between 3 PM and 8 PM while in winter they’re likely to be between 6 AM and 10 AM or 3 PM and 8 PM.
What happens during a Peak Time Event in the Smart Thermostat Program?,During Peak Time Events which occur on days with high energy demand your smart thermostat will automatically adjust by 1 to 3 degrees from your normal settings to help manage the energy load. These adjustments are pre-programmed to ensure your comfort and are usually brief lasting between 1 to 4 hours. You don't need to do anything; your thermostat handles everything and it'll return to your regular settings once the event ends.
What is the Smart Thermostat Program?,The Smart Thermostat Program is a fantastic way to manage your energy use efficiently. By enrolling your thermostat will automatically shift some of your energy use away from peak times when energy demand is high known as Peak Time Events. These events occur typically 8 to 9 times each summer and 5 to 6 times each winter lasting between 1 to 4 hours. During these events your thermostat automatically adjusts by a few degrees. This subtle adjustment helps you save on your energy bills supports more sustainable energy use and keeps the energy grid reliable. You'll earn up to $25 for signing up plus an additional $25 on your PGE bill each summer and winter season you participate. Best of all you're always in control of your comfort and can override the thermostat’s settings if you prefer a different temperature.

Additionally for each summer and winter season that you participate in at least half of the Peak Time Event hours you earn another $25. This is a great way to reduce your energy bill while contributing to a cleaner energy future.
What are Peak Time Rebates?,When energy demand and prices are high you'll have the option to reduce your energy use during the Peak Time Event which is typically 3 to 4 hours. When you reduce your energy use you can earn a rebate on your next bill. Plus shifting your energy away from peak times makes a difference. You're supporting the use of more sustainable energy resources and helping to keep energy more reliable. It’s a win-win-WIN!
When are Peak Time Events called?,Peak Time Events can be called in the morning between 7 am 11 a.m. and in the late afternoon between 3 and 8 p.m. In the winter you might notice more morning events. During the summer season Peak Time Events will most commonly occur in the late afternoon. The events can be two to five hours in length but most often last for three hours. You'll receive a notification the day before the event with the specific times it will occur.
Do I need to provide PGE with an email or mobile to participate in Peak Time Rebates?,Yes. To be enrolled in Peak Time Rebates you need to provide PGE with either an email address and/or a mobile phone number to receive Peak Time Event notifications. You can choose to receive notifications by email text or both - it's up to you. You must maintain at least one notification channel in order to remain enrolled. For example if you provide only a mobile phone number and reply STOP to text notifications you'll be unenrolled from Peak Time Rebates. You can update your notification preferences on the Peak Time Rebates webpage or call PGE Customer Service at 800-542-8818.
How are Peak Time Rebates calculated?,"Your energy use baseline is calculated from your average use over the past 10 similar days during the same hours as the Peak Time Event. You earn $1 per kilowatt hour (kWh) when you reduce below your baseline during a Peak Time Event. 

The calculation in four steps:

Step 1: PGE looks at the 10 most recent days that are similar in type (weekday or weekend). . Holidays or any previous Peak Time Event days are not considered similar days and are not included in establishing the 10-day baseline period.

Step 2: Using the selected 10 days for your baseline period PGE identifies your home’s average use during the same hours as the Peak Time Event.So if the upcoming Peak Time Event is from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m. PGE will determine your home’s average use during the hours of 4:00 -7:00 p.m.

Step 3: Because the weather on the Peak Time Event day may not be exactly the same as the 10 days selected for the baseline period PGE applies an adjustment for the difference in temperature for some customers if your historical usage indicates a significant difference in electrical use when the temperature changes. For example you may have higher use in summer because of air conditioning or in the winter due to electric heating. This will determine your home’s energy usage baseline or “Typical Use.”

Step 4: We subtract the total kilowatt hours you use during the Peak Time Event or “Actual Event Use” from your “Typical Use” as shown in the calculation below. If your energy use during the event is less than your Typical Use you earn a rebate at a rate of $1.00 per kilowatt hour.


Customer rebate baseline and rebate calculation:

(Typical Use + Weather Adjustment) – Actual Event Use = kWh Savings

kWh Savings x $1.00 = Rebate

Example with Peak Time Event data and rebate:

(3.67 kWh + 1.1 kWh) – 2.21 kWh = 2.56 kWh

2.56 kWh x $1.00/kWh = $2.56 (Rebate amount that would appear on your bill)"
How will I know if I earned a rebate after a Peak Time Event?,When you enroll in the program you have the choice to be notified by email and/or text. After each Peak Time Event you will receive a message one to three days later to let you know if you earned a rebate and for how much. If you earned a rebate this amount will appear as a credit on your next bill.
What if I don't participate in a Peak Time Event?,Your participation is completely voluntary. Once you’re enrolled you're eligible for a bill credit during any event where you successfully reduce your energy use. If you aren't able to save energy during an event you'll still be enrolled and have other opportunities to participate in the future. Your health and safety should always come first so please consider any health impacts when reducing your energy use.
I did my best to shift my energy use but didn't receive a rebate. How come?,If you're a customer who doesn't use much electricity on a daily basis it may be more difficult to reduce your use during Peak Time Events. Turning off lights or waiting to charge your phone won't make much of an impact during a Peak Time Event. You can make the biggest impact by reducing the use of major appliances using less hot water and turning your thermostat down a few degrees if you have electric heat or air conditioning.
Where will Peak Time Rebates credits appear on my bill and how often?,Peak Time Rebates will appear in the “Additional Charges/Credits” area of your bill as “peak time credits.” Rebates should appear on the next bill you receive after the Peak Time Event.
Can I be enrolled in Peak Time Rebates as well as the PGE Smart Thermostat program?,Unfortunately no — you can't be in both programs at once. However if you have a smart thermostat you may want to consider joining the PGE Smart Thermostat program where you can earn $25 per season for participating.

What is the Smart Battery pilot?,PGE launched its five-year Smart Battery pilot in 2020. Through this program PGE partners with residential customers with home battery storage systems. The program seeks to install and connect residential energy storage batteries that will contribute up to 9.5 megawatt hours of energy to our grid. Once installed these battery storage systems will help create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that is made up of residential battery systems that can be operated individually or combined to serve the grid adding flexibility that supports our transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition these home battery storage systems provide customers with a backup energy resource they can rely on in the event of a power outage.
Why is PGE doing this?,As we build a cleaner energy future and add more renewable power like wind and solar to our mix we’re developing energy storage so we can make the best use of these more intermittent resources. This is one of five projects that the OPUC (Oregon Public Utility Commission) approved to test different storage solutions to learn more about the most efficient and effective ways to store power and further modernize our grid.
How does the pilot work?,PGE will schedule times for your battery to be dispatched to provide energy at times of peak energy usage when prices are higher and electricity may be more carbon intensive. During these peak time events you always have the option to opt out and your batteries remain fully available to you during a power outage.
Will PGE discharge my battery during an outage?,No batteries are not dispatched during an outage event. All batteries remain fully available to customers during a power outage. PGE monitors weather conditions very closely and in the event that severe weather is predicted that may be more likely to cause outages your battery will not be dispatched for grid purposes. Preserving customer resilience from their battery investment is among our top priorities of this pilot.
How do I get a battery if I don't already have one?,"Contact an Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally for a bid on a battery storage system. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit. Your installer will guide you through the process of installing your battery system and connecting it to our grid. After your battery is installed you'll receive a link to connect your battery to PGE. That’s it! 









"
What does it mean to allow PGE to operate a residential energy storage battery?,Participating customers allow PGE to interact with and operate their batteries through cloud-based software. This software works as a load management system allows the dispatching of energy and offsets some stress from the grid during peak times. In a power outage the participating customer retains full battery usage as a power backup. They are always in control to opt-out or override any PGE event.
How is PGE working with Energy Trust of Oregon?,"PGE is partnering with the Energy Trust of Oregon to procure residential battery storage systems for eligible residential customers by leveraging their existing solar incentive program infrastructure and trade ally contract network.

An Energy Trust of Oregon solar trade ally can provide a bid on a new battery system. You can include solar if you’d like although it’s not required for this rebate."
What else does PGE hope to learn through this program?,"PGE will use the residential battery storage pilot to create a single resource that can help the grid balance energy production with energy demand freeing up the generation resources that are typically held on standby ready to kick in and accommodate significant fluctuation. This will allow generation resources that are typically fossil-fueled to do what they do most efficiently – generate energy.
The pilot will also allow PGE to test new smart-grid control devices across its distribution system that will more effectively allow a two-way exchange between PGE and pilot participants. The new controls will more actively manage the way that electricity is distributed across PGE’s system to incorporate energy that customers generate such as through solar panels while also meeting power demand that is less predictable such as for charging electric vehicles. The controls will allow PGE to more actively manage power distribution to improve power quality for all customers."
How often will PGE use my battery?,The pilot estimates the batteries will be dispatched about 15 times per year typically occurring during times of extreme heat or cold when there is more strain on the grid. Due to the experimental nature of the pilot PGE may also send signals for technical testing purposes. You are always in control and can opt out of any PGE dispatch.
Why should you consider joining our Smart Battery pilot?,PGE’s Smart Battery pilot studies the best ways to connect batteries at customer homes to PGE's grid. At times of peak energy usage (usually the hottest and coldest days of the year) we’ll charge or discharge your battery to either store or provide energy to the grid – about 10-15 times per year. Your batteries will remain fully available to you during a power outage or upon request and you're always in control of how much energy you wish to contribute.
Who qualifies for the Smart Battery pilot?,"If you have one of the battery systems listed below you can enroll in our Smart Battery pilot and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh for each Peak Time Event you participate in.

Tesla PGE
SolarEdge PGE
Enphase PGE
Generac PGE
FranklinWH PGE
Sonnen PGE
Duracell PGE
Eguana PGE"
What if I have a battery that's not on the qualifies list?,"You can use your current battery system as a great way to save on your bill when you participate in Peak Time Rebates.

Simply program your battery to provide some or all of the energy your home needs during a Peak Time Event."
What benefits can I get from a Smart Battery pilot program?,"Energy Trust of Oregon offers cash incentives for solar + battery storage and for batteries added to existing solar systems including higher incentives for income-qualified households. Your battery may also qualify for the Solar + Storage rebate from the state of Oregon and a 30% federal tax credit.
"
Why does my participation in this pilot matter?,"By adding your battery system to the grid you're part of a community that is creating a “virtual power plant” - one that lets us store and draws energy when needed. It’s an important step towards a clean energy future and a vital one as we add more renewables like wind and solar to the grid.

For example if our solar panels or wind turbines are generating more than usual we can store this extra clean energy in batteries and use it later to power your neighbors’ homes and businesses. That strengthens reliability and makes us better equipped to incorporate more low-cost renewable energy sources into the grid."
Which paths can I take to be a part of this pilot?,"You can choose the amount of kWh you wish to allow PGE to use of your battery during a scheduled Peak Time Event and earn bill credits of $1.70 per kWh per event. This gives you options when it comes to optimizing resilience based on your own comfort level. Each tier is based on a percentage of your battery’s total nameplate capacity.

No matter which tier you choose your battery system will remain fully available to you during a power outage. Preserving the resilience you receive from your battery system is among our top priorities."
How does the amount of bill credit vary based on the percentage of battery capacity shared during Peak Time Events?,The amount of bill credit received during each event depends on the actual amount of energy your battery provides during each Peak Time Event. This chart includes examples of potential bill credits a customer would receive sharing 80% of their capacity and participating in Peak Time Events.
